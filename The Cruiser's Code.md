# The Cruiser’s Code

Copyright (c) 2015 by WickedWick

## About
The Cruiser’s Code started with an idea about how people hook up while on cruises.  Knowing the history of the handkerchief code in the gay community, it is built on that idea but for people of all sexual preferences.

The code was created as a basis for an erotic story written by WickedWick and can be viewed here: [To Be Added].

Don’t expect to take a cruise and find people doing this anytime soon, but who knows, maybe it’ll become common practice in time.

Feel free to help contribute to the code and make this a fully formed language.  Also need information from folks who’ve been on cruise lines about what towels they provide, etc.

## Rules

1. **Always Have Your Towel** - The towel is the most important part of the code. It is the main way you’ll use to communicate. It will also allow you to dry off when you get out of the pool and clean up after successful use of the code.

2. **Don’t Fear The Rejection** - You are not the perfect person for everyone you meet.  People have different tastes at different times. Don’t worry if one day they’re interested in you and the next they’re not.

3. **The Law is the Law** - Even three miles out in international waters, the law is the law. Don’t break it.

4. **Teach Others** - The code only gets better when more people know about it and use it.

5. **No Always Means No** - Always respect people’s wishes and their right to change their mind.  You’ll feel better about yourself if you do, there’s always someone else who’ll say “Yes.”

## Towels

Each cruise line provides free towels for use while on board.  These towels are used to communicate the code to fellow cruisers.   The way you communicate depends on the towel and style of it.

### Generic White Towel
If you have a generic white towel without a clearly identifying design patter on it, you can still use it for the code.  To signify that you’re interested in a straight relationship, keep the towel vertical, long ways along your body.  For those interested in gay relationships, keep the towel horizontal or perpendicular to your body.

### Striped Towels
Striped towels following the same code as generic white towels.

### By Cruise Line
Each cruise line provides different style of towels.

##### Celebrity Cruises
##### Cunard Line
##### Disney Cruise Line
##### Holland America Line
